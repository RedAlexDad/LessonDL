CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:26 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target LessonDL because
  files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [libnvToolsExt.so.1] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /usr/local/cuda-12.3/lib64

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
